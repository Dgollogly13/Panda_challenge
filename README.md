# Panda Challenge

In this challenge, I took the role of the Lead Analyst for an independent gaming company. The company needed a variety of tasks completed, in order to gather a comprehensive view of users on their gaming platform. A few of the tasks included demographic information, top spenders, and what items were the most popular. 

## Getting Started 

As is the norm for many of these challenges, I am running this code out of my anaconda environment with Jupyter Notebook. For running this code on your machine, you will need a source-code editor with the proper dependencies installed.

### Analysis and Coding 

When analyzing the Heroes of Pymoli data, I utilized Pandas functions to clean and transorm the data per the instructions of each individual task. 

### Challenges or Additional Opportunities

One of the challenges I faced was binning the data correctly. How the user assigns the correct ranges to each bin, as well as how one divides the data is crucial. Though it sounds simplistic, data can be easily manipulated and biased when using incorrect binning techniques.

```
Percentage of Players	Total Count
<10	2.95	17
10-14	3.82	22
15-19	18.58	107
20-24	44.79	258
25-29	13.37	77
30-34	9.03	52
35-39	5.38	31
40+	2.08	12
```
